# Project Constitution: dotfiles-ai

## 1. Hierarchy & Authority
- **Global Rules (`global-rules/AGENTS.global.md`)**: The **Global Foundation**. It contains universal instructions shared across *all* projects, such as Identity, Language Policy (Japanese output), Security protocols, and cross-project SkillPort workflows.
- **Project Rules (`AGENTS.md`)**: The **Local Constitution** (This file). It contains project-specific mandates, architectural decisions, and directory structures unique to this repository. Local project rules take precedence over global rules if a conflict occurs.
- **Sub-directory Rules**: Highly specific overrides for individual agents or components (e.g., `opencode/AGENTS.md`).

## 2. Project Purpose
This repository is the Central Authority for AI Agent configurations, specialized skills, and AI-enabled development environments. It ensures a consistent "AI persona" across all tools and machines.

## 3. Directory Mandates
- `claude/`, `gemini/`, `opencode/`, `codex/`: High-level configuration for specific AI CLI tools.
- `ide/`: Configuration and extension management for Cursor and VSCode.
- `global-rules/`: Source of Truth for cross-project AI instructions.
- `agent-skills/`: The master repository for SkillPort skills.
- `mcp/`: Management of the Docker MCP Gateway and associated catalogs.

## 4. Development Workflow
- **SSOT Enforcement**: Never edit symlinked files in home directories (e.g., `~/.gemini/GEMINI.md`). Always edit the Source of Truth within this repository.
- **MCP Gateway**: Use the Unified SSE Gateway (`http://localhost:10888/sse`) for all tools. New MCP servers MUST be defined in `mcp/catalogs/custom.yaml.template`.
- **Skill Management**: New AI capabilities MUST be implemented as SkillPort skills in `agent-skills/` and managed via MCP.

## 5. Tooling & Automation
- `make setup`: Bootstrap the environment and create initial symlinks.
- `make setup-docker-mcp`: Re-render MCP configurations and synchronize all agents.
- `make sync-agents`: Propagate global rules and skill updates to all agent contexts.

## SkillPort Skills

Skills are reusable expert knowledge that help you complete tasks effectively.
Each skill contains step-by-step instructions, templates, and scripts.

### Workflow

1. **Search** - Call `search_skills(query)` to find skills matching your task
2. **Load** - Call `load_skill(skill_id)` to get full instructions and `path`
3. **Execute** - Follow the instructions using your available tools

### Tools

- `search_skills(query)` - Find skills by task description. Use `""` to list all.
- `load_skill(id)` - Get full instructions and the skill's filesystem path.

### Tips

- Use your native Read tool with `{path}/file` for templates/assets
- Execute scripts via path, don't read them into context: `python {path}/scripts/run.py`
- Replace `{path}` in instructions with the actual path from `load_skill`
- If search returns too many results, use more specific terms

## BEGIN Superpowers Workflow
# Superpowers Workflow
This project employs the [obra/superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) workflow.

## Core Rules
- **Skill-First:** Before implementation/coding actions, you MUST call `search_skills("using-superpowers")` to find the skill ID and then call `load_skill(skill_id)` to load/activate it. Follow this flow for any relevant skills you identify.
- **Planning & Design:** Solidify the design with the `brainstorming` skill and create a detailed task list with `writing-plans` before implementation.
- **TDD:** Follow the `test-driven-development` skill for all implementations by writing tests before implementation code.
- **Verification:** Execute `verification-before-completion` before finishing a task and provide success reports based on empirical evidence.
